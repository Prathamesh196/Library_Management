# Library Management System (C++)

A console-based Library Management System developed using C++ to demonstrate strong fundamentals in Object-Oriented Programming, STL, and problem solving. The application simulates basic library operations through a menu-driven interface and follows a clean, modular design suitable for core software engineering roles.

## Features
- Add new books to the library
- Display all available books
- Issue books to users
- Return issued books
- Menu-driven console interaction
- Basic input validation

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C++
- Core Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures
- STL: vector
- Tools: VS Code, g++ compiler
- Version Control: Git and GitHub

## Project Structure
Library-Management-System-Cpp/
- Book.h – Book class declaration  
- Book.cpp – Book class implementation  
- Library.h – Library class declaration  
- Library.cpp – Library class implementation  
- main.cpp – Main program with menu logic  
- screenshots/ – Output screenshots  
- README.md – Project documentation  

## Design Overview
The project is designed using object-oriented principles. The Book class represents individual books and stores details such as book ID, title, author, and issue status. The Library class manages a collection of books using an STL vector and handles operations like adding, issuing, returning, and displaying books. The main program provides a menu-driven interface and controls the application flow based on user input.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Navigate to the project directory  
3. Compile the program using  
   g++ main.cpp Book.cpp Library.cpp -o library  
4. Run the application using  
   ./library  

## Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened understanding of C++ programming
- Hands-on experience with Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- Practical use of STL containers
- Improved logical thinking and problem-solving skills
- Experience in structuring and documenting a complete project

## Future Enhancements
- File handling for data persistence
- Search functionality by book title or author
- Improved input validation and error handling


## 🏁 Conclusion

This project reflects strong command over **C++ OOP design, STL vector usage, safe state transitions, modular code organization, and clean lifecycle exit**.  
It is lightweight in scope, built with **clarity, reliability, and scalability in mindset**, making it code-review and interview ready.
